**Some steps before you start developing:**
- Update all MoonCore dependencies
- Initialize the tailwind packages by running `npm i` in the Styles folder
- Build the css with the build.sh or build.bat file
- Create a mysql database and set the credentials in the app.json as soon as you start the app the first time
